# Overview of Project
This project builds a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. It also creates filters for a fully dynamic table. By placing the table into an HTML file, users can easily view it. When the user adjusts its inputs, the table reacts accordingly.
# Results
The following details the project's steps. First, click on the index.html file to view the website. You will see a beautiful page; complete with picture, title, text and table.

\
The page explains the site's content, UFO sitings. Going to the bottom of the page, a user can identify UFO sitings by date, city, state, country or UFO shape. For example, when the user enters 1/13/2010, three results appear in the table.

A fully dynamic table permits curiousity. Users can also look at their respective locations for UFO sitings. El Cajon, CA has 5 reported UFO sitings in this demonstration

The website allows users to explore UFO sitings and make a decision for themselves: fact or fancy?
# Summary
Over time, the project could benefit from some improvements. For example, the table's filter requires inputs to hold a particular format. If a user puts 1/13/10 instead of 1/13/2010, the data will not show. The next iteration will allow for this flexibility. 
\
In addition, some filters do not effectively display information. While there are only five entries if the user enters Cajon, CA. 109 entries display if the user picks "us" for country. A summary that shows the number of results or graphs them will help users make meaning if there are numerous entries.
